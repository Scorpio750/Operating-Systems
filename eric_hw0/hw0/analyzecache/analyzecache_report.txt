In order to determine the cache size, I repeatedly went over an array of 64MB at different intervals of powers of two. 
I determined the time it took for each interval's pass over the array by getting the time of day before and after the loops and taking the difference. 
When the time spikes, I know I've reached the L2 cache, and the cache size is the interval, 1024KB. 
The cache block size is the log of the cache size, about 10B. 
I determined the cache miss penalty by subtracting the time before the spike and the time at the spike, getting 1539759us.

I've included a python script graphing the time on the y-axis and the log of the interval on the x-axis, which I used to visualize the data.

I was unable to be more exact than this based on the experiment parameters.
